            <h2> El Penol is a local, family-run, Colombian restaurant located at 54 Bennington St, Boston, MA 02128 in East Boston. They serve authentic Colombian food, and they’re known for their famous dish, the Bandejo Penol. They are known for a few reasons; food quality, taste, “clean family restaurant,” and exceptional service. They’ve been running this restaurant for 22 years.  </h2>
            <p> When I walked inside Asian Garden on a late Friday afternoon, I saw people eating late lunches and early dinners around round tables. Colorful dividers were placed between tables to promote social distancing. A Chinese drama blared from a small, propped television. The bell notifying incoming customers enter would occasionally ring. </p>
            <img class="inside1" src="inside of restaurant.png">
            <p> However, business was still stagnant and it was clear that the small family-owned restaurant was struggling to keep up against the brunt of the pandemic and the increasing rise of Asian hate crimes. </p>

         <h1> About the Business Owner </h1>
         <img class="agowner" src="ownerkawa.png" alt="picture of business owner kawa">
         <p> It all started when Marina Balvin left Colombia about 35 years ago to come for the “American Dream” she first arrived in NYC, but that didn’t work. She then arrived  to Boston in 1998 where she got an opportunity to start her business, which is now El Peñol Resturante authentic Colombian cuisine.</p>
         <p> When I asked him why he started his restaurant, he responded <span>“Because it is my passion”</span>.</p>
         <p class="paragraph"> During our phone interview, he kindly shared his experiences with me. Occasionally, he would call out an order for the kitchen to take. I could tell he was a busy man who worked extremely hard. </p>

         <h1> Adapting to the Pandemic </h1>
         <p> Before the pandemic, El Pelon was doing business normally. The pandemic only ever affected it by implementing the rules and regulations for everyone’s safety, and laying off some employees and cutting hours. 
         <p>El Pelon shut their business down for 3 week to adhere to the safety of their employees, families, friends, and the city of Boston. To adjust to the “new norm,” El Pelon requires facemasks, table distancing, hand sanitizer around the dining areas, and social distancing. </p>
         <p>The Latinx community in the Boston and the greater Boston area has been supportive to each other and to latinx businesses. </p>
         <blockquote class="blockquote"> “Us latinos help each other a lot and support one another, we are all here for one goal which is to give our family a better life and strive and stick together to reach that goal.” – Johan Medina, El Penol’s manager and grandson of Marina’s. </blockquote>
